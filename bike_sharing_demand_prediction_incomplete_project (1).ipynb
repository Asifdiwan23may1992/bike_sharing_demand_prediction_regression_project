It lets people rent bikes from one spot and drop them off at another, making getting around the city easy and green.\n","\n","Recently, more people have been using Bike Seoul, so the city needed a better way to manage it all. They wanted to predict how many bikes people would need in different places and times. This way, they could make sure there were enough bikes where people wanted them and not too many where they weren't needed.\n","\n","To do this, they used fancy computer stuff called machine learning. They gathered lots of info about bike rentals, like when and where people rented bikes, plus other stuff like the weather and holidays. Then they trained a computer model to learn from all this info and make predictions about bike demand.\n","\n","They tried out different ways of making predictions, like using math formulas and fancy algorithms. After testing lots of methods, they found one called Xtreme gradient boosting that worked really well. It was able to predict bike demand with high accuracy, around 93% for the training data and 90% for the testing data.\n","\n","This project not only provided valuable insights into bike demand patterns in Seoul but also demonstrated the practical applications of machine learning in addressing real-world problems. The findings could potentially be extended to other cities with similar bike sharing systems, leading to improved services for bike users and more sustainable transportation systems."],"metadata":{"id":"F6v_1wHtG2nS"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **GitHub Link -**"],"metadata":{"id":"w6K7xa23Elo4"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Provide your GitHub Link here."],"metadata":{"id":"h1o69JH3Eqqn"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **Problem Statement**\n"],"metadata":{"id":"yQaldy8SH6Dl"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Imagine you live in a big city where rental bikes are everywhere.
